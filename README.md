## Overview
Welcome to the **Principal_component_analysis** repository! In this repository, you will find a Python program that performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 3D-visualization on a dataset. The program focuses on determining the most relevant variables for the results obtained after the KNN-Classification process. By using PCA, we aim to understand the importance of each variable in the dataset.

## Features
- **Python Program**: The repository contains a Python program that implements PCA and generates insightful visualizations.
- **3D Visualization**: Explore the dataset in a three-dimensional space to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Variable Importance**: Understand the relevance of variables in the dataset using PCA.
- **Comments in Python Program**: Gain a deeper understanding of the code through detailed comments.

## Repository Details
- **Repository Name**: Principal_component_analysis
- **Description**: Dive into the world of PCA and variable importance analysis. Check out the Python program, 3D visualizations, and more.
